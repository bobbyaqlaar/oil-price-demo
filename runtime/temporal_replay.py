"""
runtime/temporal_replay.py — concrete Temporal `replay_handler` for
runtime/dead_letter.py's DeadLetterQueue.

Without this, `DeadLetterQueue.replay()` only flips a DB status flag —
"replayed" in name only, since the original workflow execution that
produced the entry has already terminated and there's nothing left to
resume (see FIXES_AND_CLEANUP.md's HITL/DLQ redesign). This module closes
that gap for Temporal specifically: it signals the *live, still-parked*
workflow identified by `DLQEntry.workflow_id` — which only exists because
`runtime/workflows/base_workflow.py`'s `run_with_recoverable_step` keeps
the workflow alive on failure instead of terminating it — with the
(possibly human-edited) payload, resuming exactly where it failed.

Usage (inside your Temporal worker process, which already has a Client):

    from temporal_replay import make_temporal_replay_handler
    from dead_letter import DeadLetterQueue

    dlq = DeadLetterQueue(replay_handler=make_temporal_replay_handler(temporal_client))
    dlq.replay(task_id, override_payload=edited_payload)  # -> signals the live workflow

See runtime/replay_webhook_server.py for the reference HTTP receiver a
tenant runs to let the Ops Portal trigger this remotely (the portal itself
has no Temporal client — see that module's docstring for why).

    (e.g. from within a Temporal workflow/activity) for that reason — call
    it from a plain sync context, such as the webhook receiver in
