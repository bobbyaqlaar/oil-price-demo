"""
scripts/check_bare_except.py — AST-based detector for empty exception
handlers ("swallowed" errors), used by hooks/pre-commit's Guardrail 2.

Replaces a regex check (`except\\s*(\\w+)?:\\s*$`) that matched the *header
line* of almost any `except` clause — since Python's `except X:` line
always ends right at the colon regardless of how long or short the body
underneath is, that regex flagged ordinary multi-line handlers (e.g.
`except KeyError:\\n    raise ValueError(...) from None`) as "bare except
with no handler body" while doing nothing to verify the body was actually
empty. Parsing the real syntax tree instead of pattern-matching text lines
is the only way to tell "this handler's body is genuinely a no-op" from
"this handler's body just happens to start on the next line," which is
true of essentially all idiomatically-formatted Python.

A handler is flagged only when its body is exactly one statement and that
statement is `pass` or a bare `...` (Ellipsis) expression — i.e. it does
nothing at all. `except Exception: pass` is sometimes an intentional,
documented fail-open pattern (e.g. runtime/llm_gateway.py's
_record_span_attributes, where a tracing failure must never break the
actual LLM call) — append `# fail-open: <reason>` to the `except` line to
opt that specific handler out, the same way the rest of this codebase
uses inline suppression comments rather than a blanket exemption list.

Deliberately NOT spelled `# noqa: ...` — ruff treats any `# noqa:` comment
as ITS OWN suppression directive and demands a comma-separated list of
ruff rule codes after the colon, so `# noqa: bare-except — reason` (this
checker's first convention) made ruff itself emit an "Invalid noqa
directive" warning on every annotated line. `# fail-open: ...` carries the
same meaning without colliding with ruff's own comment syntax.
